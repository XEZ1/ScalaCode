## Introduction

Welcome to the scala code collection written throughout student years. This is a collection of different code developed though various courseworks, internships and own research. The code contains 8 separate and unrelated projects. 

## Part 1 - Collatz Conjecture Solver

In this part, This repository contains a Scala program for solving the **Collatz conjecture**, also known as the **3n + 1 conjecture**. The Collatz conjecture is a mathematical puzzle that involves iteratively applying a set of rules to a positive integer until it eventually reaches the value 1. 

## Part 2 - Document Similarity Analyser

This repository contains a Scala program designed to determine the similarity between two documents, whether they are source code or English texts. The purpose of this program is to provide a tool for assessing the resemblance between documents and assisting in detecting potential plagiarism. The program utilises various techniques to achieve its goal.

## Part 3 - Infix to Postfix Expression Converter and Evaluator

Here, we present a Scala program that showcases a robust solution for converting and evaluating mathematical expressions from infix notation to postfix notation. This technique is inspired by the Shunting Yard Algorithm, a versatile method developed by Edsger Dijkstra.

## Part 4 - Long-Term Investment Portfolio Analyser

This project aims to demonstrate a practical Scala solution for evaluating investment strategies over extended periods. The code simulates investment in a portfolio of stocks using historical data, providing insights into potential gains or losses.

## Part 5 - Evil Wordle Game - Challenging Word Guessing

This project is designed to offer a unique and challenging experience for fans of the popular Wordle game. By enhancing the difficulty and strategic elements of the game, the Evil Wordle Game aims to provide a stimulating intellectual challenge while maintaining the fun and excitement of the original game.

## Part 6 - High-Performance Regular Expression Matcher

This repository contains an efficient implementation of a regular expression matcher in Scala, designed to deliver superior performance compared to mainstream languages like Java, JavaScript, Python, Swift, and Dart. The matcher is based on the derivative method devised by Janusz Brzozowski in 1964, which has been proven to significantly enhance matching speed for complex regular expressions.

## Part 7 - Knight's Tour Problem Solver

This repository contains Scala programs that address various versions of the Knight's Tour Problem on a chessboard. The Knight's Tour Problem is about finding a tour such that a knight visits every field on an n x n chessboard exactly once. The challenge becomes more complex as the dimensions of the chessboard increase.

## Part 8 - Brainf Interpreter and Compiler

This repository contains an interpreter and compiler for the brainf*** programming language, implemented in Scala. Brainf*** is an esoteric programming language known for its minimalistic set of instructions and Turing completeness.


## Installation and Usage

1. **Install Scala:** Ensure that you have Scala installed on your computer.
