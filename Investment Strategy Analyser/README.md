# Long-Term Investment Portfolio Analyser

## Introduction

Welcome to the Long-Term Investment Portfolio Analysis repository. This project aims to demonstrate a practical Scala solution for evaluating investment strategies over extended periods. The code simulates investment in a portfolio of stocks using historical data, providing insights into potential gains or losses.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to assess the performance of a long-term investment strategy across various portfolios. By analysing historical stock price data, the program provides insights into how different investment portfolios could have evolved over the years.

## Features

- **Historical Data**: The program leverages historical stock price data to simulate investments spanning 41 years, from 1978 to 2019. This data is utilised to calculate annual changes in stock prices, offering a comprehensive view of portfolio growth.

- **Diverse Portfolios**: The code considers two distinct investment portfolios: one consisting of blue-chip companies and another comprising real estate businesses. It simulates investment in stocks from these portfolios, applying a consistent investment strategy.

- **Yearly Compounding**: The program showcases the power of compounding by reinvesting profits back into the portfolio each year. This strategy reflects a real-world scenario where gains are reinvested, potentially leading to significant growth over time.

## Usage

To explore the Long-Term Investment Portfolio Analysis:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Scala is installed. If not, download and install it from [here](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/).
3. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the repository directory.
4. Run the program using the following command:
```
scala InvestmentStrategyAnalyser.scala
```
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to input portfolio selections and observe the simulated investment growth.

## Motivation

This project was initiated to simulate a practical scenario in which an investor applies a consistent yet straightforward investment strategy over an extended period. It aims to provide insights into potential outcomes of long-term investment, leveraging historical stock data. By exploring various portfolios and analyzing their growth, the code offers a glimpse into financial decision-making.
