# Evil Wordle Game - Challenging Word Guessing

## Introduction

Welcome to the Evil Wordle Game repository. This project is designed to offer a unique and challenging experience for fans of the popular Wordle game. By enhancing the difficulty and strategic elements of the game, the Evil Wordle Game aims to provide a stimulating intellectual challenge while maintaining the fun and excitement of the original game.

## Purpose

The primary objective of the Evil Wordle Game project is to create an advanced version of the classic Wordle game that pushes the boundaries of word guessing. By implementing intricate scoring mechanisms and utilising complex algorithms, the project offers users a more engaging and mentally stimulating experience, enhancing their vocabulary and critical thinking skills.

## Key Features

- **Enhanced Gameplay**: The Evil Wordle Game takes the familiar concept of Wordle and adds a layer of complexity by introducing advanced scoring rules and strategic elements. This elevates the challenge for players who seek a more thought-provoking gaming experience.

- **Scoring and Feedback**: The game provides detailed scoring feedback for player guesses, indicating correct letters in the right position, correct letters in the wrong position, and incorrect letters. This detailed feedback guides players towards refining their guesses and making informed choices.
